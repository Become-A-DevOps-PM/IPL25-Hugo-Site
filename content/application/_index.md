# Application

Web applications coordinate clients and servers through HTTP. A browser sends requests, a server processes them and returns responses, and the browser renders the result. Understanding this flow—and the components involved—enables informed decisions about application architecture and deployment.

This section covers:

- **Client-server architecture** — How browsers and servers communicate
- **HTTP protocol** — The request-response pattern that powers the web
- **Server-side rendering** — Generating HTML dynamically with templates
- **Web servers vs application servers** — nginx for connections, Gunicorn for Python code

Start with [How Web Applications Work](how-web-applications-work/) for a comprehensive overview.
