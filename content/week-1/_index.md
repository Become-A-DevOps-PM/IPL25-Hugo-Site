# Week 1: Compute

This week introduces the fundamental building blocks of server infrastructure. You will learn what servers are, how they work both physically and virtually, and how to securely connect to and manage them.

## Concepts

Understand the theory behind compute infrastructure and secure remote access:

- [Compute](/infrastructure-fundamentals/compute/) - What servers are, common server roles, and how physical and virtual servers work
- [Understanding SSH](/it-security/understanding-ssh/) - How to securely access and manage virtual machines remotely

## Exercises

Put theory into practice with progressive server provisioning exercises:

- [Server Foundation Exercises](/exercises/server-foundation/) - From portal-based VM creation to command-line automation

## Tutorials

Hands-on guides to practice what you've learned:

- [Deploy Files with SCP](/tutorials/deploying-with-scp/) - Transfer files from your local machine to a remote server

## Recap

Review the key concepts from this week:

- [Week 1 Technical Recap](/presentations/week-1-recap-slides/) - Summary of server perspectives and defense in depth security
