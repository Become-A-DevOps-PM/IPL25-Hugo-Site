# Mini-Lectures

Supplementary readings that provide context and perspective on DevOps, project management, and AI collaboration. These mini-lectures are **not required** for course completion—they offer deeper exploration of topics that often arise in discussions.

Each mini-lecture includes both a presentation for visual learners and a detailed article for those who prefer reading.
