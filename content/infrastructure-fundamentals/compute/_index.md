# Compute

Compute is the processing power that runs applications and serves users. In cloud infrastructure, this means servers—physical or virtual machines that execute code, handle requests, and provide services over a network.

This section builds understanding from the ground up: what a server is and the different forms it takes, the roles servers play in application infrastructure, how physical server hardware works, and how virtualization abstracts that hardware into flexible cloud resources. The final topic covers practical sizing and cost decisions for Azure virtual machines.

## What You Will Learn

- **Server fundamentals** - The client-server model, deployment options from bare-metal to serverless, and when each approach makes sense
- **Server roles** - How web servers, application servers, databases, reverse proxies, and bastion hosts work together
- **Physical hardware** - CPUs, memory, storage, networking, and the design principles that keep servers running continuously
- **Virtualization** - How hypervisors create virtual machines, the trade-offs of shared infrastructure, and how Azure implements VM hosting
- **Sizing and cost** - Azure VM series, matching resources to workloads, and strategies for cost optimization
