# Network

Networks connect computing devices and enable communication between servers, clients, and services. In cloud infrastructure, networking determines how virtual machines communicate with each other, how users reach applications, and how security boundaries are enforced.

This section progresses from fundamental concepts to practical implementation: what networks are and how they function, how IP addressing organizes devices into manageable groups, the distinction between private and public networks, how firewalls control traffic flow, the layered model that explains protocol interactions, and the intermediary devices that route and protect traffic.

## What You Will Learn

- **Network fundamentals** - How data flows between devices, routing and switching, and the protocols that govern communication
- **IP addressing** - IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, CIDR notation, subnetting, and how DHCP automates configuration
- **Network boundaries** - Private vs public addresses, NAT, DMZ architecture, and hybrid cloud connectivity
- **Traffic control** - Firewall rules, stateful inspection, Azure Network Security Groups, and defense in depth
- **Protocol layers** - The OSI model, TCP vs UDP, and how load balancers operate at different layers
- **Network intermediaries** - Proxies, reverse proxies, load balancers, and bastion hosts
