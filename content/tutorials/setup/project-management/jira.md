# Jira Setup

Jira is a project management tool designed for agile software development teams. It provides Scrum boards, sprint planning, and backlog management features that help teams organize and track their work.

## Goal

Set up a free Jira account with a Scrum project board ready for sprint-based development.

## Prerequisites

- Email address (recommend using a private email, not school email)
- Web browser

---

## Step 1: Create Atlassian Account

1. Navigate to [https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
2. Click **"Get it free"** or **"Try it now"**
3. Enter your email address
4. Create a password or sign up with Google/Microsoft/Apple
5. Verify your email if prompted (check spam folder)

## Step 2: Create a Workspace

When prompted to "Add Jira to a workspace":

1. Enter a workspace name (this becomes your URL)
   - Example: `myteam` creates `myteam.atlassian.net`
   - Use something memorable - you'll access Jira through this URL
2. Click **Continue**

Choose a short, memorable workspace name. This URL is how you and your team will access Jira. You can use your team name, project name, or a combination.

## Step 3: Confirm Free Plan

Jira will show you the Free plan details:

- **Free for up to 10 users**
- **Unlimited projects and boards**
- **2 GB storage**
- **Community support**

No credit card is required. Click **Get Started** to continue.

## Step 4: Select Scrum Template

Jira offers three project templates:

| Template | Description | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **KANBAN** | A simple board to visualize your workflow | Continuous flow work |
| **SCRUM** | Deliver work in short, repeatable time blocks | Sprint-based development |
| **BUSINESS** | Collaboration for business teams | Non-technical projects |

**Select SCRUM** - this is the methodology we use in this course for sprint planning and iterative development.

## Step 5: Explore Your Scrum Board

1. Accept the default project name ("My Scrum Space") or enter your own
2. Click **Next** to create the space
3. Wait for the setup to complete (a short animation shows progress)

Once setup is complete, you'll see your Scrum board with:

**Left Sidebar:**
- Spaces list
- Your project name

**Main Tabs:**
- Summary - Project overview
- Timeline - Gantt-style view
- Backlog - Where you add and prioritize work items
- Board - The Scrum board with columns
- Calendar - Date-based view
- List - Table view of all items

**Board Columns:**
- **TO DO** - Work not yet started
- **IN PROGRESS** - Work currently being done
- **DONE** - Completed work

---

## Verification

Confirm your setup is complete:

- [ ] You can log in at `yourworkspace.atlassian.net`
- [ ] You see a Scrum project board
- [ ] The board shows TO DO, IN PROGRESS, and DONE columns
- [ ] You can access the Backlog tab

## Quick Reference: Scrum Terminology

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Backlog** | A prioritized list of all work items for the project |
| **Sprint** | A fixed time period (usually 1-4 weeks) for completing work |
| **Board** | Visual representation of work items in columns |
| **Story** | A work item describing a feature from the user's perspective |
| **Task** | A smaller unit of work, often part of a story |

## Common Issues

**Workspace name already taken**
- Try adding numbers or your initials (e.g., `myteam25`, `projectx-ja`)

**Email verification not arriving**
- Check your spam/junk folder
- Try resending the verification email
- Use a different email provider if issues persist

**Cannot find login page**
- Access Jira directly at `https://yourworkspace.atlassian.net`
- Or go to [https://id.atlassian.com](https://id.atlassian.com) to see all your Atlassian products
